        I am running to be Chancellor of the University of Oxford, not because I
        have years of experience in politics or in university governance, but
        because I believe that I would bring assets to the position that no
        other candidates can offer. I am a philosophical Logician now, with an
        abstract to appear in the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, though my higher
        education was in mathematics and linguistics. These two degree programs
        taught me a lesson that I don't think I would have learned anywhere
        else: how to gracefully and tactfully respond to lay speculation and
        assumptions about what I do with my life and my studies. I have had to
        hear countless times, the best and worst of the public perception of my
        two degrees, ranging from, “So, how many languages do you speak?” to
        “Oooh, math, I hated that in high school.” Learning how to help people
        see beyond what they think they know about something is the strength
        that these remarks have given me. In response to these sorts of
        comments, I have found that a blend of humility and pride, levity and
        seriousness about my passion, it's what ultimately breaks down the
        barriers. I believe that this skill will make me an effective and
        diligent Chancellor.

        I may not have experience in politics in public office, but I have
        personally seen the ways that talking to people in ways that open their
        eyes to unseen possibilities in a way that moves their needle just the
        tiniest bit can bring even the most unexpected person into your cohort.
        I served as President of my university Math Club for two semesters, and
        received many chances to shape students' views of the subject near and
        dear to my heart in ways that were uniquely mine. I do not easily
        believe that another President would have thought that
        statistical-distribution shaped plush toys could possibly be one of the
        highest-turnout events of the year. I brought speakers who presented on
        topics that made members and visitors of the club say, “I didn't know
        math could be <em>that</em>.” I hope to do the same as Chancellor,
        making people say, “I didn't know Oxford could be <em>that</em>.”

        I believe that it is the right time for the University of Oxford to both
        reflect on its storied past and look into the future with open eyes,
        unflinching eyes, unbiased eyes. The University has many stories to
        tell, and we must learn that all of them make up a part of its history,
        learning from both the positive and the negative. The positive ones
        might be the ones by which we wish to be remembered, but it is the
        negative ones that provide the greatest room for growth. I believe that
        it is not in silencing these parts of history, but by coming to terms
        with them, that the University will come into itself in the current
        epoch of history. It is now time to ask the hard questions, not the easy
        ones. As a Logician, I have learned that it is not the individual
        problems that make us into the problem-solvers we are meant to be, but
        the looking back, the reflection upon how we solved them (or failed to
        solve them) and how they fit into the greater scope of our work that
        does this. It is the forest for the trees, the arc rather than the
        point, that makes us. It is our insertion of our most true selves that
        is what allows us to make history become ours. As Chancellor of the
        University of Oxford, I will lead these changes, starting by looking
        within.
